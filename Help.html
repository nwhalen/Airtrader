    <h2>About the system</h2>
    <p>
        Airtrader contains 3 features: Browse available tickets, Offer your own tickets, and View your offered and owned tickets. 
    </p>
    <h2>Browse Tickets</h2>
    <p>Upon clicking the Browse Tickets button, you will be met with a screen containing relevent forms where you can enter information to find a flight. The search feature is currently under development, so the screen will display three tickets from an example search for flights from Boston to Miami on 12/31/31. Click these flights to see their information. Each flight contains three buttons, Make Trade Offer, Make Token Offer, and Buy now. These three features are currently under development. </p>
    <h2>Offer a Ticket</h2> 
    <p>Upon clicking the Offer Ticket button, you will be met with a screen where you will enter the information on the ticket you wish to offer. You will have the option of enabling trade offers, or offer the ticket solely for tokens by default. Upon submitting, you will be met with an estimation of your ticket's value. </p>
    <h2>My Tickets</h2>
    <p>My Tickets will show your AirToken balance, purchased tickets, and tickets curretly offered for trade. Within this screen, you can offer your purchased tickets for tokens or trade. In the Offered Tickets section, you can view the pending offers recieved for each ticket, or you can choose to delist it.  </p>
